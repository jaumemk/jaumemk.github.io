> I'm a developer and crossmedia designer with a wide overview of new technologies, design and communication. Coding since 1998, nowadays Iâ€™m working as a senior developer. I believe in open source and making everything *simpler* and *easy*.

*Feel free to contact me for any project you've got in mind. I speak Spanish, Catalan, French and English fluently, basic German and a bit of Russian.*

### Most technologies I use are...

- PHP / Laravel / Symphony
- HTML5
- CSS / SASS
- JavaScript / jQuery / Lodash
- mySQL
- basic bash and pyton scripting
- And all the tools that allows me a happy coding workflow. (Like: composer/bower/npm, debian, archlinux, git, gulp/grunt, webpack, sublime text, ...).
